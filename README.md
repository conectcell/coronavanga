LSTM for coronavirus spreading prediction

It is made just for learning purposes and fun.
It doesn't predict data 100% accurately.


First you have to install python, pip, keras and tensorflow, pandas, numpy.



download.py downloads data from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 end extracts it to data folder

lstm.py - is actual LSTM neural network with several LSTM layers
bidirectional.py - bidirectional LSTM with one layer


Have fun.

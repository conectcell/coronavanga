LSTM for coronavirus spreading prediction

It is made just for learning purposes and fun.
It doesn't predict accurately and data.


First you have to install Python, Keras and Tensorflow



download.py downloads data from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 end extracts it to data folder

lstm.py - is actual LSTM neural network with several LSTM layers
bidirectional.py - bidirectional LSTM with one layer

make sure that you have pandas, numpy,
